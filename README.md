Hardware is based on an Arduino Pro Micro, Gerber and Schematic files are included in the hardware folder. Yo may also use any homebuilt or commercial Servo or Stepper board. Just make sure the Servos and Steppers are driven by a separate 5V Power supply.

The implementation uses the XPLDirect Plugin for X-Plane from https://www.patreon.com/posts/x-plane-direct-43341946

Compile using VS Code and the PlatformIO environment
